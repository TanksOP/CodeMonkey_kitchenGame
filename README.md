# CodeMonkey_kitchenGame
I am following a tutorial made by Code Monkey -  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmGSEH7QcDg&amp;ab_channel=CodeMonkey. 

This project aims to create a complete game with full functionality. 

After completing this tutorial I have significantly increased my understanding of some elements within the Unity game engine. This project uses events frequently to help link different elements of the project together, and uses scriptable objects, which i was unfamiliar with before doing this.
